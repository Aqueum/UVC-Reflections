When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  When I'm collaborating with others.
  If I want to show examples of my coding.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  I might receive updates that I don't want, 
  for example, if I stop working on a project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
	Branch is a side track from a line of commits, 
	most likely performed locally
	Clone is a copy of a repository either copy can be local or remote 
	(although you can't clone to GitHub)
	Fork is a clone of a remote repository (most likely someone elses)
	done on GitHub (etc.) and likely cloned to a local copy

	Use branch to explore new options in a programme
	Use clone to copy an entire respository without linking back
	Use Fork to copy someone elses work & start developing it

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
	It allows git to track whether my most recent commits have been pushed
	hence whether I am ahead or behind, in sync or out with the remote

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
  

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
