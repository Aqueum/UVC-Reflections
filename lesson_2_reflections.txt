Starting a new reflection for lesson 2
I'd rather go free text, but they seem to like giving me questions...

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git adds a .git directory 
	which includes: the files HEAD config & description 
	& the directory's hooks objects branches description info & refs
	it doesn't actually add any commits so you need to use "git add" to add all the files that you want to track
