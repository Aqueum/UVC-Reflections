Starting a new reflection for lesson 2
I'd rather go free text, but they seem to like giving me questions...

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git adds a .git directory 
	which includes: the files HEAD config & description 
	& the directory's hooks objects branches description info & refs
	it doesn't actually add any commits so you need to use "git add" to add all the files that you want to track

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	the staging area is between the working directory and the repository, containing files that we have decided to track
	I'm still guessing the value, but think its something to do with being able to limit commits to logical steps
	here there is no point in committing lesson 1 along with lesson 2, so by having a staging area we can put only 
	lesson 1's files in while working on that, then we can add lesson 2's files and remove lesson 1's from the staging area
	hence thereafter commits will only cover lesson 2
